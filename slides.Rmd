# Consumer Word of Mouth

---
class: font160
# What is Word of Mouth Marketing?

Consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their "daily dialogues"

* Why is this *new* in "social media"?
  * It isn't a new idea ...
  * The "social web" with it's increasing connectivity makes it more salient
  * ... and measurable

---
class: font160
# Types of Word of Mouth 

**Organic word of mouth**:

* People become advocates for a product and have a desire to share their views.
* **This is our focus this week**

**Amplified word of mouth**: 

* Marketers launch campaigns designed to encourage or accelerate WoM in existing or new communities.
* We'll come back to this later in the course -- "Firm Generated Content"

**Online versus Offline**

* Distinction is always lurking in the background

---
class: font160
# Social Media Word of Mouth Matters

* Consumers now spend more than 135 mins per day on social media
    - Social media sites contain a treasure-trove of decision relevant information
    - Twitter is the main platform for opinion exchange

* Social Media fostered growing importance of WoM marketing

* Chief Marketing Officers think online WoM matters
    - ... Rationalized by consumer's trust in online info from peers (Nielsen, 2013)
    - 64% of marketing executives believe word of mouth is the most effective form of marketing
    - Only 6% say they have mastered it.

---
class: font160
# Why Word of Mouth Might Matter

Three mechanisms at play:

1. Awareness
2. Buzz
3. Social learning

Most often we see:

* Awareness & Buzz $\rightarrow$ volume of tweets
* Social learning $\rightarrow$ sentiment in tweet's text
  * Sentiment often called valence

---
class: font160
# Tweet Volume Measures Awareness and Buzz

* Awareness
    * Introduces new consumers to a product
    * Reminds consumers about product
    * Reinforce traditional advertising
* Buzz: expressions of anticipation
    * Increase in anticipation $\rightarrow$ increase in volume of posts
        * By consumers who want to act as opinion leaders, and reflect their interests, excitement, and expectations
        * Generally "neutral" in sentiment

---
class: font160
# Sentiment Measures Quality

* Sentiment expressed tweet's text provides means to measure quality
* Tweet Sentiment impacts sales via social learning
    * Quality revealed through interactions with their peers
    * Relevant if consumer's use these reviews to decide what to attend

* Important to control for other ways consumers learn about quality

---
class: font160
# Why Should We Care?

- Social media can generate awareness, buzz and information diffusion that ultimately influences demand
- Important when:
    1. Relying on "hyped release strategies"
    2. Uncertainty about a product's quality
- Examples: movies, books, consumer electronics, video games, fashion

.center[**Most relevant for new products early in release**]

class: font160
# Online WoM & Causality

**Motivation**: Causal inference is particularly difficult in the realm of online WOM due to the fact that
firms are not directly in control of the amount of WOM.

**Specific Questions**:

* What is the demand elasticity of demand wrt volume of posts?
* What is the mechanism through which online WoM influences choice?

**How?**: Natural experiment -- shutdown if Sina Weibo due to political events in mainland China but not HK

* Sina Weibo $\approx$ Chinese Twitter

---
class: font160
# Empirical Approach

**Industry**: TV show viewership -- soapies

* Not really **new** products

**Data**:

* TV ratings (i.e. viewership) at episode/city level in mainland China and HK
* Microblogging activity about each show

**The Natural Experiment**: Censorship block on Sina Weibo

* Large, random shock, unrelated to TV
* Block in mainland China, **but not** HK

---
class: font150
# Difference in Differences

$$
\begin{aligned}
LogRating_{jt} = \alpha Block_{t}  &+ \beta Mainland_{j} + \delta_j Block_{t} \times Mainland_{j} \\ 
                                   &+ Weekday_t' \gamma + \varepsilon_{jt}
\end{aligned}
$$

For causality ...

* Valid Counterfactual: HK approximates China
* No Selection on Unobservables: Nothing unobserved driving treatment

class: font160
# Takeaways

* Estimated Volume elasticity: between 0.016 and 0.026

* WoM influnces demand via consumption complementarities 
  * Can chat about it later online

* Managerial Implications:
  * Fostering post-show discussion
  * Doesn't appear to be valence effects 
    * (maybe because quality is known?)

# Recent Developments

.center[
**How far to "believable" numbers can get get without experimental variation?** 

**Can we reconcile the volume vs sentiment debate?**
]

* If we can **control** for (almost) all the omitted variables
* Studied by [Deer, Crawford, Chintagunta (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227912) 

**Setting**: US Movie Industry & Twitter WoM, i.e. **new** products

**Findings**: 

* Distinguish Pre- vs Post- release volume and sentiment
* Volume **and** sentiment significant
* Small(-ish) volume elasticities, larger sentiment elasticities 
* Differs across **types** of movies
  *  Buzz: Franchise movies, 
  *  Awareness: (expected) mid-tier movies, 
  *  Social learning: (expected) small movies

# Influencer Marketing


---
class: font160
# What is Influencer Marketing?

> **Influencer Marketing**: A type of social media marketing that uses endorsements and product mentions from influencers

*Who are influencers?* Someone who has:

* Power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of his or her authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with his or her audience
* A following in a distinct niche, with whom he or she actively engages

*Types of influencers*:

* How niche they are: products / target audience 
* How large there reach is: mega, macro, micro, nano 

---
class: font150
# The Influencer Market: Stylized Facts 


* **Large and growing**, approx 9.7 billion USD in 2020
  * 2016: 1.7 billion USD, 2025: (expected) > 20 billion USD

* **Approx. 3/4 companies use influencer marketing** to some extent, mainly Instagram
  * **Only 65%** of those who use it, **track ROI**

* Becoming 'centralized' through influencer marketing agencies 
  * Interesting incentive problems here...

* Large **growth in the use of "micro" influencers** 

* Growing concern: **compliance issues**
  * Only approx 20% of (US/UK) posts meet regulatory guidelines

# Do influencers impact product demand?

---
class: font160
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: What is the effectiveness of influencer marketing on consumer demand? 

**Why relevant?**

* (Over-) Excitement about influencer marketing 
* Limited evidence beyond anecdotes 
* It's **hard** to do, but **worth** trying

**Methods**:

* No experiment but **clever empirical strategy**  
* $\implies$ think of most estimates as **causal**

**Application**: Twitch & Video Games

# What we want to know 


.center[How **Viewership of streams impacts demand**]

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Why won't linear regression suffice?


---
class: font160
# The Key Idea of the Paper 

.font120[*Ideal Experiment*]:

**Activate streamers** at **random times** to generate **exogenous variation** in **viewers** 

.font120[*Paper's "best" approximation*]:

* Variation in timing of when top streamers broadcast
* ... that should be independent of shocks to game popularity
* Essentially exploiting that streamers work "irregular" hours


---
class: font140
# Model Free Evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_modelfree.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Observations:

* Players does not immediately peak 
* Slowly returns to baseline

$\implies$ potential for short-lived effects on game usage

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

Regression Equation:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

where: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_viewerstock.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

i.e. is a weighted sum of recent viewers ...

* where the eights decay geometrically, over time 
* Set T = 72 hours (!!)

$\delta$ $\rightarrow$ persistant effect of viewership 

* "carryover" relative to "immediate" effects

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

**How do they use streamer's timing of broadcast?** 

* Technically: **instrumental variables**
* To overcome omitted variable bias and simultaneity
* See diagram in class ... 

What are the instruments?

* **Number of top streamers broadcast game $j$ at time $t$**
  * Measure this for **each of the last 12 hours**


---
class: font140
# Main Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_main_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Findings: 

* **Small**, positive & statistically significant effects $\rightarrow$ $\beta$
  * Interpret!
* Effect **persists over time** $\rightarrow$ $\delta$

---
class: font140
# Heterogeneity Across Products

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_heterog.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Largest Effects: 

* **Small** publishers 
* **High variance** in ratings 
* **Older** games  

---
class: font140
# Sponsored Versus Organic 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_sponsored.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

$\omega < 1$ $\rightarrow$ **sponsored content** effectiveness is a fraction of organic 

* **15.7% as effective as organic streams!**

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Cascades: sponsored stream generates additional organic content

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

Suppose a top streamer is sponsored to broadcast:

* **Directly increases viewership** by $\hat{\theta}_1$
* **Induces** an additional $\hat{\theta}_1 \hat{\gamma}$ to **organic broadcasters** 
* Which **generates**  $\hat{\theta}_1 \hat{\gamma} \times \hat{\theta_2}$ **more viewers**
* ...

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades_totaleffect.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

*End result* (Viewers): 

* Induces approx. 3 organic streams 
* Which is 2.6 times as many viewers than sponsored stream

*End result* (Sales):

* 1.6 sales per 1000 viewers

---
# Return on Investment (ROI)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_roi_formula.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_roi.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Median game has additional revenue of $19.50 due to sponsored streams
  * Median ROI = -86%
* 15% of games have positive ROI if do **not** account for cascades 
* 27% of games have positive ROI if do account for cascades 

$\implies$ **sponsored influencer promotions are mostly ineffective**

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **Small, positive effects** of organic influencer content **on demand** 
  * Similar in magnitude to OWoM volume and advertising 
  * ... which helps these numbers feel credible 

<br>

* **Sponsoring influencers** leads even **smaller effects** (approx 1/5th!)
  * But does lead to cascades of organic content 

<br>

* **ROI** for sponsored content is **negative for 2/3rds of games**

# Which type of influencer should a firm choose?

---
class: font160
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: How do an influencer's impressions vary with follower counts? 

**Why relevant?**

* Influencers typically paid according to follower base
* Different types $\rightarrow$ different effects
  * Mega: awareness 
  * Micro: consideration, intent, purchase 

**Application**: TikTok's Discover page

* "trending content" for > 200 hashtags
* Over six months

.center[Want a **non-linear** relationship between followers and impressions]

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` How would you go about answering the problem?
`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` What would be your "ideal experiment?"



---
class:font150
# The Authors' "Ideal" Experiment 

Imagine a **company knows the type of influencer** they want to hire

<br>

* Suppose **many "identical" influencers** of this type, but **vary only by followers count** 

* Could **collaborate with each at different points in time**

* Measure the **effect of followers on impressions** 

* This **traces out the relationship** they're interested in

<br>

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")`Is this *really* the optimal experiment?

---
class:font160
# What the authors actually do 

The thought experiment that underpins their analysis: 

* **Many potential influencers** that a company can collaborate with
  * Who **create similar content**, match desired "influencer profile"
  * **Vary in follower counts** 

* Assume the "exchangability" of influencers 


`r icons::fontawesome("rocket", style = "solid")`If company paid for more followers, would campaign metrics have differed?

# Collecting Data from Posts

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` How to get data from posts?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_posts.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Why do they need this?

---
class: font150
# Collecting Data from Posts

**Answer 1**: Machine learning

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_ml_posts.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Extracts the "data":

* Text 
* Image 
* Audio 
* Editing style

**Answer 2**: In class...

---
class: font150
# Estimating Follower Elasticities 

**Estimating equation**:

$$log(Impressions_j) = g(log(Followers_{ij}), ControlVariables_j) + e_j$$

**Challenge**:

* Follower counts likely correlated with unobservables (in the $e_j$)

$\implies$ need some extra work to claim causality 

**Solution**: "An extra modelling equation"

* Explains $log(Followers_{ij})$ via likes of *similar* content creators 

<br>

.font70[**Remark**: This won't be in the exam ... it's quite subtle]

# Main Result


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_avg_fei.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Key Takeaways**: 

* U-shaped
* Largest follower elasticity at 6,500 followers
* Similar magnitudes* to advertising effectiveness

# Role of Engagement Tactics


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_engagement_tactics.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Key Takeaways**: 

* Less than 10K followers: informative content leads to more impressions 
* Large follower base: "socializing" content leads to more impressions
  * Though less effective *on average*
* Entertaining content similar effect as informational

]
.pull-right[
**S-shaped**: "Special Effects" focussed campaign

* Only catches on if popular enough influencer posts it

<br>

**Concave**: Product Demonstration focussed campaign

* Niche audiences for this content

<br>

**Linear**: Self Expression focussed campaign 

* Broad appeal to all audiences
* This is the most frequent in the data

# Optimal Influencer Selection

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_optimal_influencer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Assume value/impression and cost per 1K followers 

$\rightarrow$ optimal number of followers for a campaign

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* If campaign focused around "social content" and socialization: influencers with a higher follower count

* If campaign focused around information: lower follower counts 
  * Why? Trust and authenticity

* Once we can quantify elasticity of impressions with respect to followers, we can establish the optimal follower count to target for a new campaign
  * Conditional on knowing cost per followers *and* assuming value generated per impression

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary

UPDATE

* Quantifying causal relationship between followers and impression is difficult 
  * But allows us to choose the "right" influencer for a campaign 
  * (with additional assumptions)

* Organic influencers have small, positive effect on demand

* Sponsored content appears to have negative ROI (on twitch, in gaming)
  * More work needed to generalize this

* Disclosing post as sponsored prevents negative association from consumers to influencer and brands 
  * Unanswered: What does it do to engagement and purchase intentions?
